# 🛡️ CLARION — Threat Intelligence Correlation & Alert Prioritisation Assistant

> **IBM Hackathon Challenge D2:** An intelligent, explainable cybersecurity operations platform that ingests multi-source sensor streams, correlates fragmented alerts into high-confidence incidents, filters false positives, maps attacker techniques to MITRE ATT&CK, and produces executive Bottom-Line-Up-Front (BLUF) briefings powered by IBM watsonx.ai.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Defence analysts receive thousands of heterogeneous alerts every day from SIEM, EDR, network sensors, satellite feeds, and intelligence reports. These signals arrive in disparate formats, duplicate alerts scatter across systems, and high false-positive ratios obscure critical attacks. SOC teams struggle with severe alert fatigue and lack explainable, automated prioritization to protect vital infrastructure.

---

## 💡 Solution

CLARION provides an end-to-end operational platform that normalizes 6 heterogeneous telemetry formats into a unified schema, performs sliding-window Union-Find graph correlation to consolidate related alerts into unified incidents, and computes a transparent 5-factor risk score (0–100). Integrated with IBM watsonx.ai (Granite 3.0), CLARION generates executive BLUF dossiers and empowers watch commanders with an interactive, grounded AI Copilot.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Multi-Source Alert Normalization:** Ingests and standardizes SIEM, EDR, Network Sensors, SIGINT, ISR, and OSINT into a single structured schema.
- **Dynamic Graph Correlation:** Correlates scattered alerts into unified security incidents using temporal clustering and shared entity graphs.
- **Explainable 5-Factor Risk Scoring:** Mathematically decomposes threat priority into Severity, Asset Criticality, Correlation Strength, Confidence, and Impact.
- **Enterprise MITRE ATT&CK Matrix:** Interactive matrix visualizing attacker progression across tactics and techniques with linked telemetry evidence.
- **IBM watsonx.ai & Grounded AI Copilot:** Generates executive BLUF briefings, on-demand attack analyses, and commander intelligence reports with offline deterministic fallback.
- **Executive White / Dark Operations Console:** Modern, responsive 14-page command floor with 1-click theme toggling and real-time telemetry dashboards.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- Real-time IBM watsonx.ai generation requires active IBM Cloud credentials; when absent, CLARION operates seamlessly in DEMO mode using its built-in deterministic analyst engine.
- Synthetic attack simulation injects realistic telemetry for Operation Nightfall but resets on database reinitialization.
